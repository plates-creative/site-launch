    <h1>emergence</h1>
    <p>Emergence began as a question we kept returning to while preparing for our launch in Austin. How could we bring the creative community together in a way that felt participatory, physical, and true to the way we like to work?</p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>For our Type Smash party, we invited people into our home and asked them to bring a plate. Together, we broke them by hand. Each person selected a single letter from the word Plates and used the shards to construct it. The act was simple, but personal. Every fragment carried its own force, intention, and moment of release. We documented each letter with the original intention of building a full experimental typeface.</p>
    <figure class="info-media">

    </figure>
    <p>From those first letters, we created a limited-run shirt that we gave away at our launch party. What remained was a large and varied library of shard fragments, each one a trace of a shared moment, shaped by a different hand. We set them aside, not as leftovers, but as material waiting for its next expression.</p>
    <p>As the year came to a close, we wanted to make something that reflected both community and individuality, and that felt right for the season without leaning on familiar tropes. The form of the snowflake offered a natural frame. Often treated as a cliché, its structure has long fascinated us. A snowflake is mathematical, precise, and deeply variable. No two are the same, yet all belong to the same system.</p>
    <p>In this experiment, the idea of individuality exists on multiple levels. Each shard was created by someone in our community. Some carry personal meaning, memory, or sentiment that we may never fully know. Those fragments are then recombined through a generative system that produces nearly infinite variations. Across 26 distinct configurations and layered randomness, the likelihood of seeing the same form twice is almost nonexistent.</p>
    <p>This website translates those physical traces into a digital environment. Built using p5.js and the HTML canvas, the system assembles snowflakes in real time from the original shard images. Shards are colorized, positioned within defined boundaries, and animated using subtle sine wave motion. From a single “arm,” the system generates a radial structure, producing between four and nine repetitions before rotating the entire composition. The result is a form that feels both ordered and alive.</p>
    <h2>Generative Audio</h2>
    <p>The audio for Emergence was designed as a generative system built on controlled randomness, mirroring the logic of the snowflake itself. A small set of voices, filtered noise, and long-tail effects are driven by probability rather than fixed sequences, allowing the piece to remain consistent without ever fully repeating. Notes are drawn from a limited pitch palette, while timing, dynamics, and occasional harmonic “blooms” shift subtly over time. Effects like delay and reverb are treated as part of the structure, letting sounds overlap and dissolve naturally. The result is an ambient environment that stochastically rifts and reshapes itself, shaped by simple rules rather than authored moments.</p>
    <p>While this experiment was built with the help of contemporary tools, including AI-assisted coding, the outcome relies on intention, iteration, and restraint. Randomness alone is not enough.
    <p>Structure matters.</p>
    <p>Constraints matter.</p>
    <p>Care matters.</p>
    <p>Emergence is not about novelty or perfection. It is about how things come together. About how individual actions can accumulate into something larger than themselves. About what becomes possible when we allow form to surface through participation, chance, and shared presence.</p>
    <p>We hope you’ll spend a little time with it and see what emerges for you.</p>
