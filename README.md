# Plates Launch Website
This site features a custom WebGL shader built with p5.js, creating a dynamic lens distortion effect over animated text. The text is rendered using a licensed version of Owners by MCKL and moves subtly with the cursor, creating an interactive, surreal visual field. We combine 2D text rendering (createGraphics) with a custom fragment shader for chromatic aberration and circular masking, pushing the creative boundaries of p5.js.

Vibe coded by Plates, with love and late nights.
